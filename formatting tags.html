    <p> <b>Paragraphs</b> are the building blocks of papers.<strong>Many students</strong>  define paragraphs in terms of <em>length:</em> a paragraph is a group of at least <i>sentences</i>, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. h<sub>2</sub>0</p>

    <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an <mark>argument</mark> and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. (A+b)<sup>3</sup></p>
